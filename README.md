# Signlingo
This is the front-end of Signlingo â€“ a sign language project I created during STEAMHacks 2023 (hosted by STEAM for Vietnam).
<br>
<br>
You can take a look at the Demo of the Signlingo here (This is the website with a back-end added).

I have not yet completed the responsive part of the website. So to best use it, please set the computer interface to be larger than 1300px*900px.
<br>
<br>
This project is supported by <b>Bootstrap Studio.</b>
<br>
P/s: Thanks to Bootstrap Studio's support, I created the front-end of this website in a very short time even though I don't know any code about HTML, CSS or JavaScript and have never done anything about the web before:).
